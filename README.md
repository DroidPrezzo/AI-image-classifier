# AI-image-classifier
Image Classifier Project
This project is part of Udacity's AI Programming with Python Nanodegree. It classifies images from a dataset using a convolutional neural network built with PyTorch. In this project, I developed code for an image classifier built with PyTorch, then converted it into a command line application.


Prerequisites:

PyTorch
Torchvision
Numpy
Json

It is recommended you use Anaconda to set up your environment.
